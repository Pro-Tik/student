## Project Overview

The Student Management System is a command-line application developed in C. It aims to help manage student information for educational purposes. The system allows the user to:

- Add new student records
- View all student records
- Search for a student by ID
- Update student information
- Delete student records
- Calculate the total number of students in the system

The system uses basic file handling to store student data persistently.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Add new students' details like ID, name, and CGPA.
- **View All Students**: Display all students' records in a tabular format.
- **Search Student by ID**: Search for a student by their ID and view the corresponding record.
- **Update Student Information**: Modify student details such as name or CGPA.
- **Delete Student**: Remove a student’s record from the system.
- **Exit the Program**: Exit the program gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language**: For developing the core logic.
- **File Handling**: To store and manage student data persistently.
- **Data Structures**: Using arrays or linked lists for data organization.
- **Standard Libraries**: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`
